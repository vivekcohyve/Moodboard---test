      "2.  **Color Palette & Lighting:** What is the dominant color palette or specific accent colors you imagine? Are we thinking soft pastels, bright and bold hues, earthy tones, or a very specific combination? Also, what kind of lighting defines the mood â€“ bright and airy, warm and cozy, or something more dramatic?\n",
      "3.  **Key Motifs & Textures:** Beyond general \"quirky art,\" are there any specific motifs, objects, or patterns that consistently appear (e.g., mushrooms, stars, tiny creatures, abstract shapes)? And what textures or materials are prominent, either in the shop's decor or the stationery itself (e.g., recycled paper, matte finishes, metallic accents, wood, ceramic)?\n",
      "4.  **Target Audience Vibe:** Who is the ideal customer for this shop, and what feeling or emotion do you want the moodboard to evoke for them? Is it playful and nostalgic, sophisticated and inspiring, calm and cozy, or something else?\n"

Emphasize a sophisticated yet playful atmosphere.\n",
      "*   **Supporting Visuals (~25%):** Secondary images that reinforce the concept, like close-ups of unique stationery items (e.g., custom notebooks, artisan pens, specialty papers, unique greeting cards), hands interacting with products, and creative packaging details.\n",
      "*   **Typography Samples (~15%):** Font examples that match the tone, featuring a mix of clean, modern sans-serif fonts for a minimalist base, complemented by a playful, whimsical, or subtly handcrafted display font for character.\n",
      "*   **Color Palette (~10%):** Dedicated swatches representing the primary color story. The foundation should be sophisticated grey tones (e.g., soft light grey, warm stone grey, charcoal accents), accented with carefully selected playful and warm colors (e.g., muted mustard yellow, dusty rose, soft sage green, or a hint of light coral) to convey \"cute and whimsical\" without being childish.\n",
      "*   **Texture/Pattern Elements (~10%):** Tactile references such as close-ups of light, natural wood textures (birch, light oak) for furniture and display elements, soft linen fabric (off-white or light grey) for backdrops or product wraps, and cozy, subtly textured wool (cream or light grey) for accents like small rugs or seating.\n",

All elements must adhere to high-end photography standards, showcasing sophisticated creative direction and cohesive visual storytelling. Ensure all elements are 4K resolution, sharp, and clear.
